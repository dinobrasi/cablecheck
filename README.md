## Basic network cable checker

Requires a loopback connector for the other end of the cable.

Wire like this:

* Pin 1 to Pin 2
* Pin 3 to Pin 6
* Pin 4 to Pin 5
* Pin 7 to Pin 8

Wiring Standards T568A snd T568B can't be determined because the only difference is the cable colors. The wiring is the same.
